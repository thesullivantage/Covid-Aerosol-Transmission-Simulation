# COVID-19 Aerosol Simulation

##### Aerosol transport simulation from an interdisciplinary Finnish collaboration refactored in Python from MATLAB, to model the spread of COVID-19 in an indoor space of variable dimension. 
- Diffusion coefficient derived from CFD simulations by the same collaboration
  - Other important parameters aggregated from various publications involving COVID transmission.
